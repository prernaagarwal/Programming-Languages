1. (4 points each)

Evaluate the following lambda calculus expressions using the call-by-value
semantics from the Week 6 slides. (In short, arguments must be evaluated before
function applications.)

Show all the steps, including the substitutions.

Every expression should reduce to an integer.

The \ character is used in place of a lower-case Greek lambda.

Vim tip: if you put your cursor over a left or right parenthesis in normal
mode and type "v%" (without quotes), it'll highlight the text between that
parenthesis and the matching one.

  a) ((\x. (\y. x)) 1) (2 + 3)
  b) if ((\x. true) 5) then (6 + 7) else false
  c) (\f. (f (f 1))) (\x. x + 1)



2. (4 points)

Show that this lambda calculus expression diverges (never finishes evaluating)
by reducing it until the evaluation process loops - i.e. until you take
a reduction step that results in an expression you've already seen.

  (\y. (y y)) ((\x. x) (\y. (y y)))



3. (5 points)

Describe in your own words how reduction order can affect whether or not a
lambda calculus expression diverges during evaluation. (Look for the
discussion of reduction order and divergence in the Week 6 slides.)
